# Desktop-Voting-Application
The project we decided to embark on and create was a desktop voting application.
It expands into two sections, one which is specially for Voters to cast their vote, checking voters list , nominees list and results.
While the other is dedicated to admin in which he can start the election, end the election , to release the results.
We provided an other option for the admin is to cast his vote.
Once the admin start the election users can log into the dashboard in which they can see the different options that they can go for.
Once they were voted their access had been denied to vote again. And they can see the results after the admin releases the results.
